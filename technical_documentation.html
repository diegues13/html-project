                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution (<code>Industry 4.0</code>) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (<code>M2M</code>)
                    and the internet of things (
                    <code>IoT</code>) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The phrase Fourth Industrial Revolution was first introduced by Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, in a 2015 article published by Foreign Affairs, "Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution" was the 2016 theme
                    of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting, in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland. On October 10, 2016, the Forum announced the opening of its Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco. This was also subject and title of
                    Schwab's 2016 book. Schwab includes in this fourth era technologies that combine hardware, software, and biology (cyber-physical systems), and emphasizes advances in communication and connectivity. Schwab expects this era to be marked
                    by breakthroughs in emerging technologies in fields such as robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, quantum computing, biotechnology, the internet of things, the industrial internet of things, decentralized consensus, fifth-generation
                    wireless technologies, 3D printing, and fully autonomous vehicles.</p>

                <h3>Detailed design principles</h3>
                <p>Interconnection — the ability of machines, devices, sensors, and people to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of things, or the internet of people (<code>IoP</code>)</p>
                <p>Information transparency — the transparency afforded by Industry 4.0 technology provides operators with comprehensive information to inform decisions. Inter-connectivity allows operators to collect immense amounts of data and information
                    from all points in the manufacturing process, identify key areas that can benefit from improvement to increase functionality</p>
                <p>Technical assistance — the technological facility of systems to assist humans in decision-making and problem-solving, and the ability to help humans with difficult or unsafe tasks</p>
                <p>Decentralized decisions — the ability of cyber physical systems to make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible. Only in the case of exceptions, interference, or conflicting goals, are tasks delegated
                    to a higher level</p>

                <h3>Data</h3>
                <p>Data and analytics are the core capabilities of each component, driven by:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Digitization and integration of vertical and horizontal value chains</dt>
                    <dd> Industry 4.0 integrates processes vertically, across the entire organization, including processes in product development, manufacturing, structuring and service; horizontally, Industry 4.0 includes internal operations from suppliers
                        to customers as well as all key value chain partners</dd>
                    <dt>Digitization of product and services</dt>
                    <dd> Integrating new methods of data collection and analysis–such as through the expansion of existing products or creation of new digitised products–helps companies to generate data on product use in order to refine products</dd>
                    <dt>Digital business models and customer access</dt>
                    <dd> Customer satisfaction is a perpetual, multi-stage process that requires modification in real-time to adapt to the changing needs of consumers</dd>

            <header>Biggest Trends</header>
            <article>
                <h3>Concepts</h3>
                <p>In essence, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include cyber-physical systems (CPS), IoT, industrial internet of things,[28] cloud computing,
                    cognitive computing, and artificial intelligence.
                </p>
                <h3>Smart factory</h3>
                <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution fosters what has been called a "smart factory". Within modular structured smart factories, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized
                    decisions. Over the internet of things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in synchronic time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the
                    value chain</p>
                <h3>Predictive maintenance</h3>
                <p>Industry 4.0 can also provide predictive maintenance, due to the use of technology and the IoT sensors. Predictive maintenance – which can identify maintenance issues in live – allows machine owners to perform cost-effective maintenance
                    and determine it ahead of time before the machinery fails or gets damaged. For example, a company in LA could understand if a piece of equipment in Singapore is running at an abnormal speed or temperature. They could then decide whether
                    or not it needs to be repaired. </p>
                <h3>3D printing</h3>
                <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution is said to have extensive dependency on 3D printing technology. Some advantages of 3D printing for industry are that 3D printing can print many geometric structures, as well as simplify the product design
                    process. It is also relatively environmentally friendly. In low-volume production, it can also decrease lead times and total production costs. Moreover, it can increase flexibility, reduce warehousing costs and help the company towards
                    the adoption of a mass customization business strategy. In addition, 3D printing can be very useful for printing spare parts and installing it locally, therefore reducing supplier dependence and reducing the supply lead time
                </p>
                <h3>Smart sensors</h3>
                <p>Sensors and instrumentation drive the central forces of innovation, not only for Industry 4.0, but also for other “smart ” megatrends, such as smart production, smart mobility, smart homes, smart cities and smart factories. Smart sensors
                    are devices, which generate the data and allow further functionality from self-monitoring and self-configuration to condition monitoring of complex processes. With the capability of wireless communication, they reduce installation
                    effort to a great extent and help realize a dense array of sensors. The importance of sensors, measurement science, and smart evaluation for Industry 4.0 has been recognized and acknowledged by various experts and has already led to
                    the statement “Industry 4.0: nothing goes without sensor systems”</p>

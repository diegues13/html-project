                Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field, the
                basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power
                transmission. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of
                alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the
                Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.

                        Nikola Tesla is believed to have been born at midnight. During his birth, lightning struck
                        during a
                        summer storm. Born to a Serbian Family in Smiljan, Tesla was nicknamed `Child of the Storm`, by
                        his
                        aunt. That said, his mother replied to that comment by calling him `Child of the light`. He was
                        born
                        based on the conventional Slavonic rites, and his birth records show he was born on July 28th.
                        Tesla
                        was the fourth child in a family of five children. The family comprised of three sisters
                        including
                        Marica, Angelina, Milka and his old brother who was known as Dane. Dane died when Tesla was
                        still at
                        a tender age. Tesla attended his early education in 1861 in Smiljan, where he acquired various
                        skills including arithmetic and he also mastered the German Language. The following year, Nikola
                        Tesla moved to a place known as Gospic. Here, his father played the role of a Parish Pastor.

                        In 1875, Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He was a disciplined
                        student and achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams. More so, he also
                        started a cultural club and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the Technical
                        Department. During his second year, he got into an argument with one his professors over the
                        functionality of the Gramme dynamo.

                        Tesla’s uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to finish his studies. He arrived
                        late
                        to enroll for classes, and his lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not
                        qualify
                        for the classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in Philosophy at the university,
                        though he did not receive grades for the courses.

                        In 1881, he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph company. Upon arriving, he
                        noticed
                        that the Budapest Telephone Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in
                        another company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and he was given the
                        position
                        of chief electrical engineer. During his tenure, he introduced various operation upswings which
                        improved the performance of the company.

                        In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison
                        Company.
                        He began working in a new industry by installing indoor lighting resources. His company had
                        several
                        divisions, and he worked in the section of the company that was responsible for lighting
                        systems. At
                        this company, he improved his electrical engineering prowess. The management team noticed his
                        abilities and soon introduced him as part of the team that would produce dynamos and motors.
                        Following this, Tesla moved to New York in the USA. In 1884, one of his managers from Paris was
                        relocated to the US to manage a company where he worked. During, this time, Tesla started a
                        manufacturing division that was found in New York and sought for Tesla to be relocated to the
                        country as well. In the same year, Tesla was relocated to the USA and started working
                        immediately.

                        various
                        patents. Serrel introduced Tesla to various businessmen, including Benjamin Vail and Robert
                        Lane.
                        They agreed to help finance a new light production company under Tesla Name. Tesla worked to
                        acquire
                        the patents for the company including developing an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained

                    <dd>
                        In 1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, a form
                        of
                        power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various
                        benefits,
                        especially in long-distance power transmission. In particular, the motor was operated by a
                        polyphase
                        current, which produced a rotating magnetic field to operate the motor. This innovative electric
                        motor was patented in May 1988, and it comprised of a basic self-starting design that did not
                        require the use of commutators. As a result, this reduced the occurrence of sparking the high

                        After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and
                        capacitive
                        coupling. This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.`
                        He
                        tried in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based on near field and
                        capacitative coupling. He even performed various public demonstrations, where he would light up
                        Geissler tubes to impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over a decade trying to
                        come

                        In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York. He died alone, and his body
                        was
                        found by a maid who ignored a do not disturb sign on Tesla’s room. The assistant medical
                        professional evaluated the body and determined the cause of death was related to coronary
                        complications. A few days after the FBI ordered for the acquisition of his belongings, John G
                        Trump
                        was called in to evaluate his works. Trump was a well known electrical engineer who worked for

                        This is one of his first ever inventions that caused a stir at the 1893 Worlds Fair in Chicago.
                        The resulting conclusion from Edison and Tesla`s argument on the distribution and production of
                        electricity was provided. The argument could be summarized in relation to cost and safety
                        factors. It was determined that the DC current produced by Edison was costly over long distances
                        and it also produced sparks from the commutator. Edison and his proponents used various
                        approaches to oppose Tesla`s Alternative Current as a solution. Edison tried to prove by going
                        as far as electrocuting animals to prove his point. That said, Tesla responded by showing that
                        AC was safe by shooting current through his body to produce light. This argument is regarded by
                        most as the culmination of well over a decade of wrangles in terms of patents, corrupt deals and
                        stolen ideas. Despite it all, this proves that the system developed by Tesla is effective at
                        providing power in the modern era.

                        crucial in how it’s distributed and produced. He came up with fluorescent bulbs in his lab 40
                        years before they became a standard in the consumer market. More so, at the world`s fair, he
                        used glass tubes by customizing them into the names of famous scientists, to create neon signs.

                        photography. This resource has the ability to observe life force, which is now common in medical
                        diagnostics. It was a transformative piece of technology which Tesla was key in it`s
                        development. Similar to many of his inventions, the inspiration for X-rays came from his belief

                        It’s important to note that the Guglielmo Marconi is initially credited to be the inventor of
                        the original radio technology. However, the Supreme Court denied his patent in 1943, when it was
                        determined that Tesla originally built the radio years before. In particular, Radio signals
                        occur naturally and require a transmitter and receiver to be used. This is a technique that
                        Tesla demonstrated at a presentation in 1892 before the National Electric Light Association.
                        Five years later, Tesla made a patent application. However, in 1904, the patents were overturned
                        with the U.S patent office determining that Marconi was the original owner. This was mainly due
                        to the backing that Marconi had and the state, which was afraid of paying royalties to Tesla

                        With his exceptional prowess in scientific concepts, Nikola Tesla came up with the idea that all
                        people are inspired by external impulses. In fact, according to him, every thought and act, was
                        inspired by external stimuli. As a result, he came up with the concept of robotics. That said,
                        an aspect of humanity was still present, with Tesla claiming the human replicas have limitations
                        including growth and procreation. Nevertheless, Tesla worked with all his information to come up
                        with practical solutions. Some of his visions for the future including robotic companions, use
                        of sensors, autonomous systems and intelligent vehicles.

                        Tesla is also believed to have played a major role in the invention of the laser. Lasers have
                        played an important role in various medical procedures such as surgery. Besides that, the laser
                        has also been key in the development of digital media. That said, his invention of the laser is
                        a classical example of crossing into the worlds of science fiction. The main paradox here being
                        that laser energy can be beneficial for the society and potentially dangerous at the same time.
                        Lasers are still evolving and most techniques are based on the research by Tesla.

                        These two technologies are directly linked and they can have a significant impact in our daily
                        lives. J.P Morgan gave Tesla the funding to develop a technology that would leverage the
                        occurrence of natural frequencies in the universe to transmit data. This includes a broad range
                        of information that could be communicated including voice messages, text and images. This
                        represented the world’s first communication resources, but it also showed that there was a
                        worldwide technology that could be used to connect the entire world.
